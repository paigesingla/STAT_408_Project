# STAT_408_Project

This repository holds code for Loyola University Chicago's STAT 408 final project.

This project aims to answer the question "What characteristics of an individual's lifestyle are significant predictors of obesity?"

Multiple models including a linear regression mode, a logistic regression mode, and a proportional odds model were created to help answer this question.
